<h2>DESCRIPTIONS</h2>
<p>This app's function is to be able to search users useing github's Api. I used React thru creat-react-app, instead of useings the "fetch method" I used the library axios to make the calls to github's pi. The information is distributed to my components thru react's "context" hook. I also used the react's "reducer" hook to dispatch actions to alter the state for may app. This css was also all made peace by peace there is no framwork for the styles. This app was intented to help me solidify my understanding of curtain react hooks along with build some thing fun and interesting. You will find my app Is deployed to netlify.</p><a href="https://joshua-personal-website.herokuapp.com/">My Site
